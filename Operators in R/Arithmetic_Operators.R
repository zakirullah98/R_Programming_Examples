# Add two vectors
v1 <- c(3,4,5,6)
v2 <- 1:3
print(v1+v2)

# Subtract 2nd vector from 1st
v2 - v1

# Multiply both vectors
v1 * v2

# Divide the 1st vector witht the 2nd
v1/v2

# Compute the remainder(Modulo Operator in R)
v1%%v2

#Quotient
10 %/% 3   # Returns 3  (3 fits into 10 three whole times)
15 %/% 4   # Returns 3
9 %/% 2    # Returns 4
7 %/% 7    # Returns 1
5 %/% 8    # Returns 0


# Compute the Quotient
v1%/%v2

# Compute raised to power of other vecotor
v1^v2
